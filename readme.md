Fyi, I'm still putting this together.

# Welcome to the Automated Corona Builder ![ ](http://url/to/img.png)

## Project Overview

The Automated Corona Builder codebase is broken down into the following components...

### Git-Tracked Components

| Component (tracked) | Location |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Python script which coordinates the whole build process | `builder.py` |
| Controls for which themes publish to which deployment level (i.e. prod, beta) and with which version code | `builder-settings.json` |
| Not sure why I'm documenting this obvious piece | `.gitignore` |
| zlib/libpng license | `LICENSE` |
| This file lol | `readme.md` |

### Non-Git-Tracked Components

Many of these are autogenerated by the Automated Corona Builder CLI.

| Component (untracked) | Location | Generated by |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Private keys used for signing apps | `private_keys/` | must be created manually |
| Root folder of your Corona SDK project | `src/` | must be created manually |
| Production build arguments given to Corona's `CoronaBuilder` | `build_arguments/` | `builder.py` |
| Production Corona builds to be uploaded to app stores | `builds/` | `builder.py` |

## Setup
### Setup i need to work on this section
1. Install Click for the CLI by running `sudo pip install click` and `sudo pip install watchdog` and `sudo pip install pillow` and `python3 -m pip install Pillow`
2. Or run `python3 -m pip install click` and `python3 -m pip install watchdog`
3. Install Xcode command line tools by running `xcode-select --install`.

## How to use it
### Commands
* `python3 builder.py`

## TODO
### CLI
* finished the `builder.py` script. (I have one finished, but I'm just cleaning it up and slowly migrating it into this new git project)
* add setup documentation
* add setup documentation for the iOS-SDKs.json file you need to change in Corona (or something like that?)
* maybe think of a less confusing name? `CoronaBuilder` is a CLI Corona made, but mine is called Automated-Corona-Builder. And my python script is called `builder.py`...kind of confusing.
* support continuous deployment
